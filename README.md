## Overview

This project focuses on using **machine/deep learning models** and **conformal prediction** to identify NFC tags based on their unique responses to ISO15693 commands. The key component of the project is the `GNURadio` program, which integrates machine learning models to predict which NFC tag is responding to a transmitted command.

## Folder Structure

### Machine_Learning

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating various machine learning models.  
- **`TagMAPIE.ipynb`**:  
  - Main notebook used for training MAPIE models.  
  - Evaluates accuracy for each model.  
  - Implements conformal prediction to refine the final predictions.


### Slides

- PowerPoint presentation explaining the data collection process.

### Script

- This folder contains the core code and simulations for the research, organized into subfolders:

#### MATLAB

- Contains legacy MATLAB files used in the early stages of the research.

#### Python

- Includes scripts for data visualization and testing functions before integration into the GNURadio flowgraph.

#### MAPIE_Models

- Contains seven machine learning models used in conformal prediction for NFC tag response analysis.

#### GNURadio

- This folder is the backbone of the project and includes the primary programs:

##### Send_Command

- Transmits an ISO15693 command based on the provided flag bits.

##### Response_Collection

- Collects tag responses from 52 NFC tags for training and testing machine learning models.

##### Realtime_Prediction

- **Main program of the project**.
- Performs prediction of NFC tags using conformal prediction:
  1. Sends an **inventory request** to a tag.
  2. Collects responses for **four different response types**:
     - One Subcarrier High Data Rate (OneHigh)
     - One Subcarrier Low Data Rate (OneLow)
     - Two Subcarriers High Data Rate (TwoHigh)
     - Two Subcarriers Low Data Rate (TwoLow)
  3. Uses collected responses with MAPIE models to identify the responding tag.

- **Important Notes**:
  - Requires specific versions of `MAPIE` and `scikit-learn`.
  - Requires adjusting the `self.personal_path` variable in the Predict Tag block to match your local file paths for the repository main folder.
  - The trained MAPIE models used in `Conformal prediction` program are **not included** in this repository due to their large size.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**:  
  Utilizes MAPIE and conformal prediction to enhance prediction accuracy.

- **Data Diversity**:  
  Processes four unique response types from NFC tags to train and test models.


- **ISO15693 Protocol Implementation**:  
  Uses software-defined radio to interact with NFC tags using ISO15693 commands.

## Dependencies and Setup

### MAPIE and scikit-learn Versions

- The `NFC Tag prediction` program requires specific versions of `MAPIE` and `scikit-learn`. Follow these steps to ensure the correct setup:

1. Open Command Prompt (CMD) as an administrator.
2. Activate the GNURadio Python environment:
   ```bash
   C:\ProgramData\radioconda\Scripts\activate
3. Check installed versions:
    ```bash
    pip show scikit-learn
    pip show mapie
4. Verify that the version are as follows:
    
    scikit-learn: __1.3.2__
    mapie: __0.9.1__
5. If they don't match:
    ```bash
    pip uninstall scikit-learn
    pip uninstall mapie
    pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2
    pip install mapie==0.9.1
